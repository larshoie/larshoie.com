block project_info
  | A meta-newspaper exploring implications of algorithmic content models on design and communication in the future of printed news. Based on a flexible layout and typographic system, the design emphasises a common frame of reference while simultaneously allowing the content to wholly shape the design.

    p Investigate the layout and typo-graphic structure of newspapers. Analyse as many forms as you can find &ndash; Tabloids, right wing, left wing, local, foreign, anything goes. Organise the relevant research into a thoughtfully argued statement. You are encouraged to shape your own message. Any design decisions will be based on your statement. Absolutely anything is possible as long as you stick to these rules.

    p Traditional newspapers are not personally tailored to my generation's needs, interests or world-view. We have neither the time nor the energy to read through most articles. What we need is a truly personal newspaper &ndash; a newspaper for our generation.
