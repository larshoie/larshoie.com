block blurb
  | Our solution was based on the Norwegian word ‘Ildsjeler’ which are people with a real passion and dedication for something, in this instance, beer brewing. Visually it harkens back to a simpler time in Norway, before the mass produced beer took over the market. The grid came out of the need for an easy to use system to accommodate the many new brews, and at the same time increase brand cohesion. It was also of utmost importance to remain authentic to the people, the process and the location.
