block project_info
  | Most alphabet books are aimed at children. This book is not aimed at teaching letterforms but instead to be a vehicle for typographic experimentation. The varying letterforms were inspired by a combination of the aesthetics of Suprematism, Constructivism and De Stijl (and a little hint of Roy Lichtenstein).
